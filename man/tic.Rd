\title{Finds "clean" templated insertion chains eg paths and cycles of junctions with span > min.span
by first identifying jbp pairs within max.insert distance for which the "left" jbp is + and "right" jbp is -
(in reference coordinates) excluding any jbp that have more than one ALT jbp
(or optionally loose ends) with min.cushion distance.  These remaining jbp pairs
are then combined into a graph, and connected components in that graph are
scraped for paths and cycles, which are marked on the graph and added as metadata
to the outputted gGraph}
