\item{rafile}{(character) path to junctions file}

\item{get.loose}{(logical) get loose ends. warning: not implemented yet!}

\description{
load SV data as GRangesList
}
\details{
Reads a file containing SVs and returns a GRangesList.
Supported file types are:
- .rds (containing GRangesList or Junction object)
- .bedpe/.bedpe.gz
- .vcf/.vcf.gz

VCF files produced from the following WGS junction callers are supported:
- SvABA (https://github.com/walaj/svaba)
- GRIDSS (https://github.com/PapenfussLab/gridss)
- delly (https://github.com/dellytools/delly)
- novoBreak (https://github.com/czc/nb_distribution)

In addition, the following long read callers are supported:
- SVIM (https://github.com/eldariont/svim/wiki)
- PBSV (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbsv)
- Sniffles2 (https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles)
- cuteSV (https://github.com/tjiangHIT/cuteSV)

This function will load rearangements with the following SVTYPE values:
- DEL (requires END field)
- DUP (requires END field)
- INV (requires END field)
- TRA (for this SVTYPE, the INFO fields CHR2 and CT are also required)
- BND (requires ALT field with proper formatting)

Note that we currently ignore SVTYPE INS rearrangements. In addition, SVTYPE BND rearrangements must have an ALT field corresponding to a single distal site. At this time, we will not load single breakends without a distal site, or breakends with multiple distal sites.
